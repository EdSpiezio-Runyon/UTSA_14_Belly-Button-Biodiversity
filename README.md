## Background
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provides information on the microbial species that colonize human navels. The dataset includes operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in more than 70% of people and relatively rare OTUs. In this project, an interactive dashboard is built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

## Website
The active website for this project can be viewed here: https://EdSpiezio-Runyon.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity. The website provides interactive charts and a drop-down menu that allows users to select the individual's ID to display their demographic information and the top ten microbial species present in their navel.

## Files
The repository contains the following files:
#### - index.html - HTML file containing the webpage structure and layout.
#### - samples.json - JSON file containing the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.
#### - app.js - JavaScript file containing the code for creating the interactive charts and dropdown menu.
#### - style.css - CSS file containing the styling for the webpage.
#### - README.md - README file containing the information about the project.

## Libraries
This project utilizes the following libraries:
#### - Plotly.js - A JavaScript data visualization library.
#### - D3.js - A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

## Conclusion
This Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard project provides an interactive way to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. With this dashboard, users can select individual IDs to display their demographic information and the top ten microbial species present in their navel. This project demonstrates the use of Plotly.js and D3.js libraries to create interactive data visualizations.
